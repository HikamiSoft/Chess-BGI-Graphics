# Chess-BGI-Graphics
That's _**chess**_ plus the __movement rules and checks__, equipped with a basic __BGI graphics__. It's for two players. I forgot to add the castle move, and the pawn change. The program has little bug on Checkmates: some works, others doesn't :P. _I made alone the entire program in less than a week. I had never worked on a bigger project, at that time._ The idea came after we studied classes in C++.
