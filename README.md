# Chess-BGI-Graphics
That's chess plus the movement rules and checks, equipped with a basic BGI graphics. I forgot to add the castle move, and the pawn change. The program has little bug on Checkmates: some works, others doesn't :P. I made alone the entire program in less than a week. I had never worked on a bigger project, at that time. The idea came after we studied classes in C++.
